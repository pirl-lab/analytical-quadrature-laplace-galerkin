# Analytical Quadrature Laplace Galerkin

## Introduction
This repository contains a Matlab implementation of the algorithm presented in the following paper:
Nail A. Gumerov, Shoken Kaneko, and Ramani Duraiswami. "Analytical Galerkin boundary integrals of Laplace kernel layer potentials in $\mathbb{R}^3$." https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03247 (2023).


## Description

- The main routine of the proposed algorithm is implemented in GalerkinLaplaceTriGS.m. It recursively calls I3, I2, I1, and I0 functions for the recursive dimensionality reduction. 
- GalerkinLaplaceTriNum.m implements the evaluation of Galerkin integrals using the integrate2 function from Matlab as a reference.
- expan_GrammSchmidt.m implements the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process described in the appendix A.1. of the paper.
- The plots and tables presented in the paper can be reproduced by following the procedure described below:
  - The plots in Figure 2 in the manuscript can be generated by running the following scripts:
    - Left subplot:
      - get_Fig_onetouch_data.m - creates Fig_onetouch_data.mat using the GalerkinLaplaceTriGS function
      - plot_Fig_onetouch.m - plots the data created using the previous script
    - Center subplot:
      - get_Fig_twotouch_data.m - creates Fig_twotouch_data.mat using the GalerkinLaplaceTriGS function
      - plot_Fig_twotouch.m - plots the data created using the previous script
    - Right subplot: 
      - get_Fig_hypersingularity_data2.m - creates Fig_hyper_data2.mat using the GalerkinLaplaceTriGS function
      - plot_Fig_threetouch.m - plots the data created using the previous script
  - The numbers in Table 2 can be generated by running TestSalle.m
